# Wiings: Advanced Bird Species Identification and Birding Hotspot Finder

Birds are vital to Earth's biodiversity, acting as indicators of environmental health, controlling pest populations, and contributing to ecosystem balance. However, identifying bird species manually can be challenging and time-consuming for ornithologists and birdwatchers alike. While numerous bird books and traditional methods exist, they often fall short in terms of efficiency and accuracy. 

## Project Overview

Wiings is an innovative application designed to streamline the identification of bird species using state-of-the-art image processing techniques. Powered by the Yolov5 algorithm, Wiings enables users to simply upload an image of a bird and receive instant predictions of the species, along with detailed characteristics such as lifespan, habitat, and origin. The application also identifies key birdwatching hotspots based on the species detected, offering users a comprehensive tool for both research and recreational birding.

## Key Features

- **Bird Species Identification**: Utilizing the Yolov5 algorithm, Wiings processes images to predict bird species with impressive accuracy.
- **Comprehensive Bird Data**: The app provides detailed insights into each identified species, including characteristics, average lifespan, and geographic origin.
- **Birdwatching Hotspots**: Wiings suggests ideal locations for birdwatching based on the species identified, catering to both ornithologists and casual birders.

## Performance

The Wiings application achieved a precision of 0.731, recall of 0.745, and a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.758, demonstrating its strong performance in bird species identification.

## Conclusion

Wiings is dedicated to transforming the way we interact with and learn about birds. By leveraging cutting-edge image recognition technology, the app offers a powerful yet accessible tool for bird lovers and researchers, bringing the beauty and diversity of "The Kingdom of Birds" directly to the user's fingertips.
